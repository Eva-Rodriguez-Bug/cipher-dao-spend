| **Frontend** | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite | Modern, fast UI development |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui | Beautiful, responsive design |
| **Blockchain** | Ethereum Sepolia Testnet | Decentralized infrastructure |
| **Wallets** | RainbowKit + Wagmi + Viem | Multi-wallet support |
| **Encryption** | FHE via Zama Protocol | Privacy-preserving computation |
| **Smart Contracts** | Solidity with FHE Support | On-chain governance logic |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Git
- MetaMask or compatible wallet

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Eva-Rodriguez-Bug/cipher-dao-spend.git
cd cipher-dao-spend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Environment Setup
Create `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID=11155111
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_CONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_walletconnect_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
```

## 🎯 How It Works

```mermaid

    A[Connect Wallet] --> B[View Proposals]
    B --> C[Cast Encrypted Vote]
    C --> D[FHE Encryption]
    D --> E[Wait for Results]
    E --> F[Automatic Execution]
    F --> G[Treasury Update]
```

### Governance Flow
1. **🔗 Connect**: Link your crypto wallet securely
2. **📋 Propose**: Create detailed spending proposals
3. **🗳️ Vote**: Cast encrypted votes on proposals
